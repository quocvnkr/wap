    <h1>About Bao Quoc Nguyen</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Bao and I am <span class="trait">simple, easy-going,</span> and <span class="trait">sporty
            person.</span>. My favorite quote is: “Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I
        have a precious human
        life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to
        others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others,
        I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can. (<em

                <dd>The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the
                    event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also
                    present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business.
                    Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those
                    who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's
                    influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old
                    values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and
                    wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.</dd>
